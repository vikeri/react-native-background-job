# react-native-background-job [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-background-job.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-background-job) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/vikeri/react-native-background-job.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/vikeri/react-native-background-job)

Schedule background jobs that run your JavaScript when your app is in the background or if you feel brave even in foreground.

The jobs will run even if the app has been closed and, by default, also persists over restarts.

This library relies on React Native's [`HeadlessJS`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/headless-js-android.html) which is currently only supported on Android.

On the native side it uses either [`Firebase JobDispatcher`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-jobdispatcher-android) or a [`AlarmManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html).

-   Firebase JobDispatcher (default): The jobs can't be scheduled exactly and depending on the Android API version different `period` time is allowed. `FirebaseJobDispatcher` is the most battery efficient backward compatible way of scheduling background tasks. 

-   AlarmManager by setting `exact` to `true`: Simple propriatery implementation that is only ment to be used while testing. It only cares about executing on time, all other parameters are ignored - job is not persisted on reboot.

## Requirements

-   RN 0.36+
-   Android API 16+

## Supported platforms

-   Android

## Getting started

`$ yarn add react-native-background-job`

or

`$ npm install react-native-background-job --save`

### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-background-job`

### Manual installation

<!--
#### iOS

1. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-background-job` and add `RNBackgroundJob.xcodeproj`
3. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libRNBackgroundJob.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`
4. Run your project (`Cmd+R`)<

-->

#### Android

1.  Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainActivity.java`
    -   Add `import com.pilloxa.backgroundjob.BackgroundJobPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
    -   Add `new BackgroundJobPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method in `MainApplication.java`
2.  Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:


            include ':react-native-background-job'
            project(':react-native-background-job').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/react-native-background-job/android')

3.  Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle` and bump the minSdkVersion to 21:


              compile project(':react-native-background-job')

## Usage

The jobs have to be registered each time React Native starts, this is done using the `register` function. Since HeadlessJS does not mount any components the `register` function must be run outside of any class definitions (see [example/index.android.js](example/index.android.js#L24-L35))

Registering the job does not mean that the job is scheduled, it just informs React Native that this `job` function should be tied to this `jobKey`. The job is then scheduled using the `schedule` function. **By default, the job will not fire while the app is in the foreground**. This is since the job is run on the only JavaScript thread and if running the job when app is in the foreground it would freeze the app. By setting `allowExecutionInForeground` to `true` you allow this behavior. It is recommended that you do't use this, but for quick jobs should be fine.

For a full example check out [example/index.android.js](example/index.android.js)

### register

Registers the job and the functions they should run.

This has to run on each initialization of React Native and it has to run in the global scope and not inside any
component life cycle methods. See example project. Only registering the job will not schedule the job.
It has to be scheduled by `schedule` to start running.

**Parameters**

-   `obj` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** 
    -   `obj.jobKey` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** A unique key for the job
    -   `obj.job` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** The JS-function that will be run

**Examples**

```javascript
import BackgroundJob from 'react-native-background-job';

const backgroundJob = {
 jobKey: "myJob",
 job: () => console.log("Running in background")
};

BackgroundJob.register(backgroundJob);
```

### schedule

Schedules a new job.

This only has to be run once while `register` has to be run on each initialization of React Native.

**Parameters**

-   `obj` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** 
    -   `obj.jobKey` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** A unique key for the job that was used for registering, and be used for canceling in later stage.
    -   `obj.timeout` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** The amount of time (in ms) after which the React instance should be terminated regardless of whether the task has completed or not. (optional, default `2000`)
    -   `obj.period` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** The frequency to run the job with (in ms). This number is not exact, Android may modify it to save batteries. Note: For Android > N, the minimum is 900 0000 (15 min). (optional, default `900000`)
    -   `obj.persist` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** If the job should persist over a device restart. (optional, default `true`)
    -   `obj.override` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Whether this Job should replace pre-existing jobs with the same key. (optional, default `true`)
    -   `obj.networkType` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** Only run for specific network requirements. (optional, default `NETWORK_TYPE_NONE`)
    -   `obj.requiresCharging` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Only run job when device is charging, (not respected by pre Android N devices) [docs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/job/JobInfo.Builder.html#setRequiresCharging(boolean)) (optional, default `false`)
    -   `obj.requiresDeviceIdle` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Only run job when the device is idle, (not respected by pre Android N devices) [docs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/job/JobInfo.Builder.html#setRequiresDeviceIdle(boolean)) (optional, default `false`)
    -   `obj.exact` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Schedule an job to be triggered precisely at the provided period. Note that this is not power-efficient way of doing things. (optional, default `false`)
    -   `obj.allowExecutionInForeground` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Allow the scheduled job to be executed even when the app is in foreground. Use it only for short running jobs. (optional, default `false`)

**Examples**

```javascript
import BackgroundJob from 'react-native-background-job';

const backgroundJob = {
 jobKey: "myJob",
 job: () => console.log("Running in background")
};

BackgroundJob.register(backgroundJob);

var backgroundSchedule = {
 jobKey: "myJob",
}

BackgroundJob.schedule(backgroundSchedule);
```

### cancel

Cancel a specific job

**Parameters**

-   `obj` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** 
    -   `obj.jobKey` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The unique key for the job

Cancels all the scheduled jobs

**Examples**

```javascript
import BackgroundJob from 'react-native-background-job';

BackgroundJob.cancelAll();
```

### setGlobalWarnings

Sets the global warning level

**Parameters**

-   `warn` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** 

**Examples**

```javascript
import BackgroundJob from 'react-native-background-job';

BackgroundJob.setGlobalWarnings(false);
```

## Debugging

If you are using Android API +25 you can manually trigger the jobs by using the following command in a terminal:

```sh
$ adb shell cmd jobscheduler run -f your.package jobIntId
```

`jobIntId`: is the hashed `jobKey`. Get that value by going to [Java REPL](http://www.javarepl.com/term.html) and input:

```java
"yourJobKey".hashCode();
// 1298333557
```

## Troubleshooting

### `No task registered for key myJob`

Make sure you call the `register` function at the global scope (i.e. not in any component life cycle methods (render, iDidMount etc)). Since the components are not rendered in Headless mode if you run the register function there it will not run in the background and hence the library will not find which function to run.

See [example project](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job/blob/c0e4bc8e9dd692695169d6c9855d39e2ff917a61/example/index.android.js#L20-L25)

### `AppState.currentState` is `"active"` when I'm running my Headless task in the background

This is a [React Native issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/11561), you can get around it by calling `NativeModules.AppState.getCurrentAppState` directly instead.

### My job always runs in the background even if I specified `requiresCharging`, `requiresDeviceIdle` or a specific `networkType`

This is an [Android issue](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=81265), it seems that you can not have these restrictions at the same time as you have a periodic interval for pre Android N devices.
