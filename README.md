# react-native-background-job [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-background-job.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-background-job) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/vikeri/react-native-background-job.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/vikeri/react-native-background-job)

Schedule background jobs that run your JavaScript when your app is in the background or if you feel brave even in foreground.

The jobs will run even if the app has been closed and, by default, also persists over restarts.

This library relies on React Native's [`HeadlessJS`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/headless-js-android.html) which is currently only supported on Android.

On the native side it uses either [`Firebase JobDispatcher`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-jobdispatcher-android) or a [`AlarmManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html).

-   Firebase JobDispatcher (default): The jobs can't be scheduled exactly and depending on the Android API version different `period` time is allowed. `FirebaseJobDispatcher` is the most battery efficient backward compatible way of scheduling background tasks. 

-   AlarmManager by setting `exact` to `true`: Simple propriatery implementation that is only ment to be used while testing. It only cares about executing on time, all other parameters are ignored - job is not persisted on reboot.

## Requirements

-   RN 0.36+
-   Android API 16+

## Supported platforms

-   Android

## Getting started

`$ yarn add react-native-background-job`

or

`$ npm install react-native-background-job --save`

### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-background-job`

### Manual installation

<!--
#### iOS

1. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-background-job` and add `RNBackgroundJob.xcodeproj`
3. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libRNBackgroundJob.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`
4. Run your project (`Cmd+R`)<

-->

#### Android

1.  Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java`

    -   Add `import com.pilloxa.backgroundjob.BackgroundJobPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file.
    -   Add `new BackgroundJobPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method.

2.  Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:

        include ':react-native-background-job'
        project(':react-native-background-job').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/react-native-background-job/android')

3.  Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle` and bump the minSdkVersion to 21:

        compile project(':react-native-background-job')

## Usage

The jobs have to be registered each time React Native starts, this is done using the `register` function. Since HeadlessJS does not mount any components the `register` function must be run outside of any class definitions (see [example/index.android.js](example/index.android.js#L24-L35))

Registering the job does not mean that the job is scheduled, it just informs React Native that this `job` function should be tied to this `jobKey`. The job is then scheduled using the `schedule` function. **By default, the job will not fire while the app is in the foreground**. This is since the job is run on the only JavaScript thread and if running the job when app is in the foreground it would freeze the app. By setting `allowExecutionInForeground` to `true` you allow this behavior. It is recommended that you do't use this, but for quick jobs should be fine.

For a full example check out [example/index.android.js](example/index.android.js)

### register

[index.js:39-55](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job/blob/ff0fe73675342c38e391093f64d9e25dafe6d4f2/index.js#L39-L55 "Source code on GitHub")

Registers the job and the functions they should run.

This has to run on each initialization of React Native and it has to run in the global scope and not inside any
component life cycle methods. See example project. Only registering the job will not schedule the job.
It has to be scheduled by `schedule` to start running.

#### Parameters

-   `obj` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** 
    -   `obj.jobKey` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** A unique key for the job
    -   `obj.job` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** The JS-function that will be run

#### Examples

```javascript
import BackgroundJob from 'react-native-background-job';

const backgroundJob = {
 jobKey: "myJob",
 job: () => console.log("Running in background")
};

BackgroundJob.register(backgroundJob);
```

### schedule

Schedules a new job.

This only has to be run once while `register` has to be run on each initialization of React Native.

#### Parameters

-   `obj` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** 
    -   `obj.jobKey` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** A unique key for the job that was used for registering, and be used for canceling in later stage.

  .catch(err => console.err(err));
```

## Troubleshooting

### `No task registered for key myJob`

Make sure you call the `register` function at the global scope (i.e. not in any component life cycle methods (render, iDidMount etc)). Since the components are not rendered in Headless mode if you run the register function there it will not run in the background and hence the library will not find which function to run.

See [example project](https://github.com/vikeri/react-native-background-job/blob/c0e4bc8e9dd692695169d6c9855d39e2ff917a61/example/index.android.js#L20-L25)

### `AppState.currentState` is `"active"` when I'm running my Headless task in the background

This is a [React Native issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/11561), you can get around it by calling `NativeModules.AppState.getCurrentAppState` directly instead.

### My job always runs in the background even if I specified `requiresCharging`, `requiresDeviceIdle` or a specific `networkType`

This is an [Android issue](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=81265), it seems that you can not have these restrictions at the same time as you have a periodic interval for pre Android N devices.

## Pull Request Details

### Included function for checking if the app is ignoring battery optimizations. #62

In Android SDK versions greater than 23, Doze is being used by apps by default, in order to optimize battery by temporarily turning off background tasks when the phone is left undisturbed for some hours.

But, some apps may require background tasks to keep running, ignoring doze and not optimizing battery (this means battery needs to be traded off for performance as per required). Apps that require continuous syncing of data to the server at short intervals of time are examples of such apps.

It would be good if the developer can check whether the app is optimizing battery. If it is, the user can be notified that the app would not perform as per expected and it will work properly only if the user manually removes it from the battery optimizing apps list which can be found in
Settings-> Battery -> Options (button on top right) -> Battery Optimization and then selecting "All Apps" to change the battery optimization settings for the particular app.

The Changes that have been made are specifically for that purpose, a function  (isAppIgnoringBatteryOptimization) has been included. It checks if the app is ignoring battery optimization and returns false if it is optimizing battery (in which case the user has to manually remove it from battery settings) and true otherwise.

Logic has also been added for scheduling the task by ignoring battery optimizations, if the app has been manually removed from the battery optimization list in settings (by the User).
